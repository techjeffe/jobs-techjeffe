# AI Exposure of the US Job Market

A research tool for exploring Bureau of Labor Statistics [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/) (OOH) data and one fork-specific attempt to score how exposed different occupations may be to AI.

This fork builds on Josh Kale's restoration of the original project after Andrej Karpathy briefly shared it and took it down. Josh preserved the pipeline, data, and visualization so the work did not disappear.

## What's here

The BLS OOH covers **342 occupations** spanning every sector of the US economy, with detailed data on job duties, work environment, education requirements, pay, and employment projections. We scraped all of it, scored each occupation's AI exposure using an LLM, and built an interactive treemap visualization.

This repository is best understood as an exploration tool, not a paper or a rigorous labor-economics model. The scores are useful for inspection and debate, but they are still heuristic judgments produced by an LLM-guided pipeline.

## Data pipeline

1. **Scrape** (`scrape.py`) — Playwright (non-headless, BLS blocks bots) downloads raw HTML for all 342 occupation pages into `html/`.
2. **Parse** (`parse_detail.py`, `process.py`) — BeautifulSoup converts raw HTML into clean Markdown files in `pages/`.
3. **Tabulate** (`make_csv.py`) — Extracts structured fields (pay, education, job count, growth outlook, SOC code) into `occupations.csv`.
4. **Score** (`score.py`) — Sends each occupation's Markdown description to an LLM (Gemini Flash via OpenRouter), asks for component scores (agentic output potential, cognitive synthesis complexity, environmental unpredictability, ontological human necessity, systemic accountability), and derives a final AI Exposure score from 0-10 in code. Results saved to `scores.json`.
5. **Build site data** (`build_site_data.py`) — Merges CSV stats and AI exposure scores into a compact `site/data.json` for the frontend.
6. **Prompt export** (`make_prompt.py`) — Packages the dataset, current methodology, and summary statistics into `prompt.md`, a single markdown file designed for LLM analysis.
7. **Website** (`site/index.html`) — Interactive treemap visualization where area = employment and color = AI exposure (green to red).

## AI exposure scoring

Each occupation is scored on a single **AI Exposure** axis from 0 to 10, measuring how much AI will reshape that occupation. The score considers both direct automation (AI doing the work) and indirect effects (AI making workers so productive that fewer are needed).

Instead of asking the model for one final score directly, the pipeline now asks for component judgments about:
- agentic output potential
- cognitive synthesis complexity
- environmental unpredictability
- ontological human necessity
- systemic accountability

The final exposure score is then derived in code from those components. This reduces how much the final number depends on a single prompt and makes the logic easier to inspect, debate, and tune.

### Component definitions

- **Agentic output potential**: Whether the final value of the job is something software can directly produce or execute, and whether the market would usually accept that output as a substitute.
- **Cognitive synthesis complexity**: How much the role depends on high-dimensional reasoning, novel synthesis, or multi-variable judgment.
- **Environmental unpredictability**: How messy, physical, site-specific, and hard to standardize the working environment is.
- **Ontological human necessity**: Whether the value depends on a real human being there as a human, including empathy, trust, authenticity, identity, legitimacy, or live presence.
- **Systemic accountability**: The amount of non-delegatable professional, legal, or ethical responsibility attached to the role.

### Current weighting

The current score is computed with this profile:

```text
0.38 * agentic_output_potential
+0.10 * cognitive_synthesis_complexity
+0.22 * (10 - environmental_unpredictability)
+0.20 * (10 - ontological_human_necessity)
+0.10 * (10 - systemic_accountability)
```

There is also an **agentic cap**:
- if `agentic_output_potential <= 1`, the final score is capped at `2.5`
- if `agentic_output_potential == 2`, the final score is capped at `3.5`
- if `agentic_output_potential == 3`, the final score is capped at `4.5`

### Why these weights

- **Agentic output potential gets the most weight** because the central question is whether AI can produce the economically relevant final output, not just assist parts of the workflow.
- **Environmental unpredictability is a strong barrier** because many occupations remain hard to automate mainly due to real-world execution, not because the reasoning is especially complex.
- **Ontological human necessity also matters a lot** because some jobs are not just about producing an artifact; they depend on trust, authenticity, legitimacy, or live human presence.
- **Systemic accountability matters, but less than the above** because liability can slow or limit substitution, even when the technical work is automatable.
- **Cognitive synthesis complexity has a modest positive weight** because the scoring assumes advanced AI can increasingly handle non-routine cognitive work, so complexity alone is not treated as a major shield.
- **The agentic cap exists to keep low-agentic physical jobs in a reasonable range**. A role should not score as highly exposed just because it lacks empathy or formal liability if the final value still depends on embodied, physical execution.

### Why the weights changed over time

Some of the weighting and cap changes were driven by obvious edge cases in the data:

- **Dancers and choreographers** initially scored too high because choreography can be digitized and AI can imitate performance-like output. We pushed more weight toward ontological human necessity because the real product is still embodied human performance, live presence, and audience acceptance of a real performer.
- **Athletes and sports competitors** are an even clearer version of the same issue. A robot or synthetic simulation might technically reproduce some physical behavior, but the market does not treat that as a substitute for human competition. That is why very low agentic output plus very high human necessity now effectively floors the score.
- **Drywall installers, ceiling tile installers, and tapers** exposed a different failure mode: low-empathy, low-liability physical work drifting too high just because it is procedural. The current agentic cap is meant to stop that. If the final value is still on-site, embodied physical execution in messy real-world conditions, the occupation should stay in the low-exposure range even if AI can assist planning or measurement.

**What this score is not:**
- It is not a prediction that a job disappears.
- It does not capture demand elasticity, regulation, union power, labor shortages, or cultural preferences for human work.
- It does not tell you whether employment in a field will rise or fall overall.
- High exposure can mean a job is transformed, compressed, or reorganized rather than eliminated.

**Calibration examples from the dataset:**

| Score | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0-1 | Minimal | Roofers, janitors, construction laborers |
| 2-3 | Low | Electricians, plumbers, nurses aides, firefighters |
| 4-5 | Moderate | Registered nurses, retail workers, physicians |
| 6-7 | High | Teachers, managers, accountants, engineers |
| 8-9 | Very high | Software developers, paralegals, data analysts, editors |
| 10 | Maximum | Medical transcriptionists |

## Visualization

The main visualization is an interactive **treemap** where:
- **Area** of each rectangle is proportional to employment (number of jobs)
- **Color** indicates AI exposure on a green (safe) to red (exposed) scale
- **Layout** groups occupations by BLS category
- **Hover** shows detailed tooltip with pay, jobs, outlook, education, exposure score, and LLM rationale

## Prompt export

[`prompt.md`](prompt.md) packages this fork's dataset, component-based scoring method, aggregate statistics, and full occupation list into a single markdown file intended for copy-pasting into an LLM. It also includes a summary of how the current scoring differs from the earlier approach.
